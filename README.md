Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Diwali sales project involves examining and understanding the data related to sales during the Diwali festival season. Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is one of the most significant festivals in India and is associated with increased consumer spending across various product categories. Here's how you might approach EDA for a Diwali sales project:

Data Collection: Gather data related to sales transactions during the Diwali season. This might include information such as date of purchase, product category, quantity sold, price, location, customer demographics, etc.

Data Cleaning: Clean the data to handle missing values, outliers, duplicates, and inconsistencies. Ensure that the data is in a suitable format for analysis.

Descriptive Statistics: Calculate summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, etc., to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.

Time Series Analysis: If the data includes a time component (e.g., daily or hourly sales data), perform time series analysis to identify any trends, seasonality, or patterns in sales over time. This can help in understanding the impact of Diwali on sales.

Visualization: Create visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, line plots, pie charts, etc., to visualize the distribution of sales across different categories, geographical regions, time periods, etc. Visualization can provide insights into sales trends and patterns.

Segmentation Analysis: Segment the data based on different factors such as product category, customer demographics, geographical region, etc., and analyze sales performance within each segment. This can help in identifying lucrative market segments and targeting strategies.

Correlation Analysis: Explore relationships between different variables such as sales volume, price, promotions, and other factors. Correlation analysis can help in understanding the factors that influence sales during the Diwali season.

Hypothesis Testing: Formulate hypotheses about the factors that may impact Diwali sales (e.g., Does promotional pricing lead to higher sales during Diwali?), and conduct hypothesis tests to validate or refute these hypotheses.

Predictive Modeling (Optional): Build predictive models to forecast sales during future Diwali seasons based on historical sales data and other relevant factors. Machine learning techniques such as regression, time series forecasting, etc., can be used for this purpose.

Insights and Recommendations: Summarize the findings from the EDA and provide actionable insights and recommendations to stakeholders. This could include recommendations for marketing strategies, pricing strategies, product assortment, etc., to maximize sales during the Diwali season.
